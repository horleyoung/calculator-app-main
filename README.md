## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned
I learnt how to use try and catch error for the calculations, and how to use the array method slice for the deleting a number on the display.

```js
proud of this Javascript code
    try {
        display.textContent = eval(display.textContent);
    } catch (error) {
        display.textContent = "Error";
    }   
```

### Continued development

I still want to improve on turning my ideas,algorithm for using a Javascript components without searching stack overflow or google. 

### Useful resources
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand array methods. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
